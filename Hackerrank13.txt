Submissions will no longer be placed on the leaderboard. You may still attempt this problem for practice.

Welcome to Day 13! Check out this video reviewing abstract classes, or just jump into the problem. It's important to understand Inheritance before attempting this challenge.

Following is an example of abstract class in java:

abstract class Book{
    String title;
    String author;
    Book(String t,String a){
        title=t;
        author=a;
    }
    abstract void display();
  }
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create a new instance of it. Attempting to instantiate an abstract class (such as abstract class Book, provided for you in the editor) like so:

Book new_novel=new Book("The Alchemist","Paulo Coelho"); 
results in error: Book is abstract; cannot be instantiated. This type of class is only meant to serve as a base or blueprint for connecting the subclasses that inherit it.

To use an abstract class, you must create its subclass and then instantiate the subclass. Any abstract methods declared in the abstract class (such as abstract void display() in abstract class Book) must be implemented by the subclass.

In the editor we have provided the abstract Book class and a Solution class. In the Solution class we created instance of a class called MyBook. Your task is to write just the MyBook class. The class MyBook mustn't be public.

Note: Since this is a very specific Object-Oriented topic, we have only enabled a few languages for which abstract classes make sense. If you don't find your favorite language, try to experiment with the provided languages or come back for the upcoming challenges.

Input Format

Input from STDIN is already handled in the code given in the editor. MyBook's constructor must have the following parameters: String title, String author, and int price.

Output Format

The void display() method should print and label the respective title, author, and price of the book's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:

Title: $title
Author: $author
Price: $price
Note: The $ is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.

Sample Input

The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
248
Sample Output

Title: The Alchemist
Author: Paulo Coelho
Price: 248


SOLUTION

import java.util.*;
abstract class Book
{
    String title;
    String author;
    Book(String t,String a){
        title=t;
        author=a;
    }
    abstract void display();


}

class MyBook extends Book{
    
    public int price;
    
    MyBook(String t, String a, int p){
        super(t, a);
        price = p;
    } 
    
    public void display(){
        System.out.println("Title: " + title + "\nAuthor: " + author + "\nPrice: " + price);
    }
}


public class Solution
{
   
   public static void main(String []args)
   {
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      String title=sc.nextLine();
      String author=sc.nextLine();
      int price=sc.nextInt();
      Book new_novel=new MyBook(title,author,price);
      new_novel.display();
      
   }
}
