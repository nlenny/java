Instructions

This coding exercise will cover some basic programming skills. It should take you about 45 minutes; we don't have a hard-limit on the time, so don't worry if you turn it in a few minutes late. Don't take more than five extra minutes, though.

You may not finish all the questions; this is expected. Do as much as you can within the time limit.

Use either your own Ruby setup, or repl.it.

Please do not search Google for answers to the problems. Please do not post the problems anywhere on the internet; we will retract your admission if you do this.

You may complete the exercise in any of the following languages: Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java.

crazy_sum

Write a method named crazy_sum(numbers) that takes an array of numbers. crazy_sum should multiply each number in the array by its position in the array, and return the sum.

crazy_sum([2]) == 0 # (2*0)
crazy_sum([2, 3]) == 3 # (2*0) + (3*1)
crazy_sum([2, 3, 5]) == 13 # (2*0) + (3*1) + (5*2)
crazy_sum([2, 3, 5, 2]) == 19 # (2*0) + (3*1) + (5*2) + (2*3)
Make sure your code works for arrays with repeats of the same number (like [2, 3, 5, 2]). Hint: be careful about using Array#index; why?

square_nums

Write a method square_nums that takes a number max and returns the number of perfect squares less than max. Do not use Math.sqrt(x) or x ** 0.5; we don't want you to calculate square roots for this problem. You will, however, want to find squares (x * x is fine).

square_nums(5) == 2
square_nums(10) == 3
square_nums(25) == 4
crazy_nums

Write a method crazy_nums that takes a number, max, and returns an array of the integers that

ARE less than max
AND ARE divisible by either three or five
BUT ARE NOT divisible by _both_ three and five
You should return the result in increasing order.

You may wish to use the modulo operation: 5 % 2 returns the remainder when dividing 5 by 2: 1. If num is divisible by i, then num % i == 0.

crazy_nums(3) == []
crazy_nums(10) == [3, 5, 6, 9]
crazy_nums(20) == [3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18]
